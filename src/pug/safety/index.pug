      h4.my-4 What is an Earthquake?
      p An earthquake is when the ground shakes violently. Large earthquakes are very dangerous because they can destroy buildings.
      p In recent weeks, Taiwan’s eastern region has experienced multiple earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 5 to 6. Please carefully review the following guidelines to minimize potential damage.

        li #[strong If you’re near a table]: Hide under the table and hold onto its legs for stability.
        li #[strong If there’s no table nearby]: Crouch down next to a sturdy pillar or wall, and protect your head and neck with a backpack.

      ul

        li Keep away from glass doors, windows, or hanging light fixtures.
        li Use a backpack or your hands to protect your head and neck while moving.
        li Avoid using elevators. Evacuate through safety doors and staircases.
      h5.my-4 If trapped in a collapsed building
      ul
        li Stop bleeding if injured. Don’t remove objects stuck in you.
        li Cover mouth and nose to slow breathing initially, avoiding inhaling toxic dust.
        li Communication systems may fail initially. Save phone battery, wait a while before calling 119 for help.
        li If phone dies, use nearby hard objects to tap on sturdy walls or metal to attract rescuers’ attention. Don’t scream and waste energy.
      h4.my-4 DON’T PANIC
